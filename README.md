# NSynth - A different take on multimedia content #
NSynth is a 100% managed framework for working with multimedia content such as images, video and audio streams.

## Project Goals
There are plenty of well-established libraries and programs to work with multimedia content. Here's how we differ from the others:
* NSynth focuses on quality. _The suggested pixel format for video data is 128-bit RGBA, or 128-bit Y'Cb'Cr_
* API consistency and ease of use is paramount. You'll find the library easy to use regardless of the scope of your project.
* Portability is automatic. Because NSynth is written in pure managed code, and has no dependencies on unmanaged components or proprietary windows-only or linux-only components, it can be used on any system that can run .NET applications.
* It's MIT/X11 licensed because free software needs to be free to be used and linked to, not just free to distribute.
* It's reasonably fast. _Benchmarks will be posted later as the codebase matures._
